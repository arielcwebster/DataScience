What - Write a short paragraph explaining what the tool you are creating a tutorial for is. 
Why - Write a short paragraph explaining why someone might want to use this tool and what situations it would be helpful in.
How - Write a step by step explanation for how your tool is used. You should take screenshots of every step as well as listing each link in paths needed to find buttons (ex. File->Save) Examples should be provided with at least two data sets and each data set should illustrate something different about the tool. 
Data - Finally you should link to an excel spreadsheet that has all the data you used so your classmates can try out your tool for themselves. 


You have been asked to create a website to act as a quick tutorial for github. Github is ideal for creating websites because it is free and you can store code and data files that are easily referenced by in the outward facing websites you create. This example webpage should show you what I expect for the level of detail of your website, it should also help you put together the actual website itself. 

# How to Create a Github Website

## Step 1 - Account

Create a github account, if you don't already have one, by going to [this link](https://github.com/) and clicking the **Sign Up** button at the top right of the page. This should be free to do.

## Step 2 - Repository

Create a new repository for AdvancedDataScience.

## Step 3 - Settings -> Danger Zone -> Public

If you made a private repository you will need to make it public. It is good to keep you repositories private until you are ready to show the world what you have been working on. If you would like to keep a private repository you can upgrade by paying about $5 a month (not recommended for this class).

</p>

Go to **Settings** at the top right of the page. Scroll down until you see **Danger Zone** then click on the button that says **Change Visibility** and make the repository **Public**. You will need to type or paste the name of your repository at the bottom of the window to confirm your decision.

## Step 4 - Settings -> Pages

If you skipped over **Step 3** because you already have a public repository go to **Settings** at the top right of the page. 

<p align="center">

</p>

Then click on the last item on the menu on the left of the screen, **Pages**.

If you did follow **Step 3** you can get to pages slightly more quickly by clicking on the link directly above the Danger Zone section under GithubPages that says "Check it out here!"

Note! I have not included two data sets for explanation here because doing so doesn't make as much sense when creating a website as it does with using a tool in excel. You *do* need to provide examples of how your tool is used on two datasets.
